# Binary Analysis
The Binary Analysis repository is designed to analyze binary star systems using observational data and synthetic spectra. This repository includes neural networks to create high-resolution synthetic spectra for the AAT HERMES spectrograph, scripts to run binary star analyses, and tools for post-processing and visualizing the results.
